> This document aims to raise awareness on how you might be vulnerable to social engineering and how you may be able to mitigate those attacks.


# Social Engineering Attacks.

Social engineering is a type of cyber attack that relies on human interaction to gain access to confidential information or systems. It is a form of manipulation used by attackers to deceive you into providing sensitive information or granting access to restricted areas.

Social engineering attacks can have serious consequences for the organization. Attackers can use the information they gain to commit identity theft, steal money, or gain access to confidential information. Organizations can suffer financial losses, reputational damage, and disruption of operations.

Social engineering attacks are a serious threat to organizations and individuals. By understanding the risks and taking steps to protect yourselves, you can reduce the risk of becoming victims of social engineering attacks.

## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

> These are the various attacks that you might be vulnerable to


### Spear phishing

Spear phishing is a type of cyber attack that targets specific individuals or organizations. It is a form of social engineering, which uses deception to manipulate people into revealing confidential information or performing certain actions. Unlike other types of phishing attacks, spear phishing is highly targeted and personalized. Attackers use personal information about their victims to craft convincing emails that appear to come from a trusted source. The goal of spear phishing is to gain access to sensitive data such as your passwords. 

> As an admin this type of attack can be targeted at you, Therefore you need to take the following steps to protect yourself from being a victim.

1. Be wary of emails that contain urgent requests or threats.
2. Verify the sender’s identity before responding to any emails.
3. Do not click on links or open attachments from unknown senders.
4. Use two-factor authentication whenever possible.
5. Use strong passwords and change them regularly.


### Pretexting

Pretexting is a social engineering technique that uses a made-up scenario to manipulate victims into divulging personal information. A pretext can be anything from a fake job offer to a romantic interest. Threat actors use this technique to steal victims’ personal data. The goal of pretexting is to create a situation in which the victim is compelled to divulge confidential information. The threat actor will use any means necessary to get the victim to trust them, including appearing genuine and convincing. Once the victim trusts the threat actor, they will likely provide them with confidential information. 

Whenever you're receiving such kinds of calls, emails, etc, always be careful of giving out sensitive information right away, ask probing questions and see the response of the person calling you. 

### Baiting

A baiting attack is a type of social engineering attack in which an attacker uses physical media, such as a USB drive, CD-ROM, or DVD, to entice a victim into downloading malicious software or revealing sensitive information. The attacker will often disguise the malicious content as something desirable or interesting to the victim. For example, the attacker may disguise a malicious file as a game, movie, or other type of media. Once the victim downloads the file, the malicious code is executed and can be used to gain access to the victim's system or network.

Baiting attacks are particularly effective because they rely on human curiosity and gullibility. The attacker does not need to have any technical knowledge in order to carry out this type of attack; all they need is an enticing piece of bait and a way to deliver it to their target. Additionally, baiting attacks can be difficult to detect because they often appear as legitimate files or programs.

As a rule of thumb, **Never** plug in a drive that you found unattended, because the attacker might be baiting you.

### Shoulder Surfing

Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering attack in which an attacker attempts to gain access to confidential information by observing the victim’s activities. The attacker stands close to the victim and watches as they enter passwords, PIN numbers, or other sensitive information into a computer or other device. 

Shoulder surfing is often used in combination with other social engineering techniques such as phishing or pretexting. It can also be used to gain access to physical locations, such as buildings or offices, by observing someone else entering their access code.

To protect against shoulder surfing attacks, it is important to be aware of your surroundings and take steps to ensure that no one is able to observe your activities. This includes using privacy screens on computers and devices, covering keypads when entering passwords or PINs, and being aware of anyone who may be standing too close when entering sensitive information.
